# NAME
yarsync - a file synchronization and backup tool

# SYNOPSIS
**yarsync** [**-h**] \[**\--config-dir** *DIR*\] \[**\--root-dir** *DIR*\] \[**-q** | **-v**\] *command* \[*args*\]

[comment]: # (to see it converted to man, use pandoc yarsync.1.md -s -t man | /usr/bin/man -l -)

# DESCRIPTION
Yet Another Rsync stores rsync configuration
and synchronizes repositories with the interface similar to git.
It is *efficient* (files in the repository can be removed
and renamed freely without additional transfers),
*distributed* (several replicas of the repository can diverge,
and in that case a manual merge is supported),
*safe* (it takes care to prevent data loss and corruption)
and *simple* (see this manual).

# QUICK START

To create a new repository, enter the directory with its files and type

    yarsync init

This operation is safe and will not affect existing files
(including configuration files in an existing repository).
Alternatively, run **init** inside an empty directory and add files afterward.
To complete the initialization, make a commit:

    yarsync commit -m "Initial commit"

**commit** creates a snapshot of the working directory,
which is all files in the repository except **yarsync** configuration and data.
This snapshot is very small, because it uses hard links.
To check how much your directory size has changed, run **du**(1).

Commit name is the number of seconds since the Epoch (integer Unix time).
This allows commits to be ordered in time, even for hosts in different zones.
Though this works on most Unix systems and Windows, the epoch is platform dependent.

After creating a commit, files can be renamed, deleted or added.
To see what was changed since the last commit, use **status**.
To see the history of existing commits, use **log**.

Hard links are excellent at tracking file moves or renames
and storing accidentally removed files.
Their downside is that if a file gets corrupt,
this will apply to all of its copies in local commits.
The 3-2-1 backup rule requires to have at least 3 copies of data,
so let us add a remote repository \"my\_remote\":

    yarsync remote add my_remote remote:/path/on/my/remote

For local copies we still call the repositories \"remote\",
but their paths would be local:

    yarsync remote add my_drive /mnt/my_drive/my_repo

This command only updated our configuration,
but did not make any changes at the remote path (which may not exist).
To make a copy of our repository, run

    yarsync clone new-replica-name host:/mnt/my_drive/my_repo

**clone** copies all repository data (except configuration files) to a new replica
with the given name and adds the new repository to remotes.

To check that we set up the repositories correctly, make a dry run with \'**-n**\':

    yarsync push -n new-replica-name

If there were no errors and no file transfers, then we have a functioning remote.
We can continue working locally, adding and removing files and making commits.
When we want to synchronize repositories, we **push** the changes *to*
or **pull** them *from* a remote (first with a **\--dry-run**).
This is the recommended workflow, and if we work on different repositories
in sequence and always synchronize changes, our life will be easy.
Sometimes, however, we may forget to synchronize two replicas
and they will end up in a diverged state;
we may actually change some files or find them corrupt.
Solutions to these problems involve user decisions
and are described in **pull** and **push** options.

# OPTIONS

**\--help**, **-h**
: Prints help message and exits.
Default if no arguments are given.
After a command name, prints help for that command.

**\--config-dir=DIR**
: Provides the path to the configuration directory if it is detached.
Both **\--config-dir** and **\--root-dir** support tilde expansion for
user's home directory. See SPECIAL REPOSITORIES for usage details.

**\--root-dir=DIR**
: Provides the path to the root of the working directory for a detached repository.
Requires **\--config-dir**.
If not set explicitly, the default working directory is the current one.

**\--quiet**, **-q**
: Decreases verbosity. Does not affect error messages (redirect them if needed).

**\--verbose**, **-v**
: Increases verbosity. May print more rsync commands and output.
Conflicts with **\--quiet**.

# COMMANDS

All commands support the **\--help** option.
Commands that can change a repository also support the **\--dry-run** option.

**\--dry-run**, **-n**
: Prints what will be transferred during a real run, but does not make any changes.

**\--help**, **-h**
: Prints help for a command or a subcommand.

# checkout

**yarsync checkout** \[**-h**] \[**-n**] *commit*

Restores the working directory to its state during *commit*.
WARNING: this will overwrite the working directory.
Make sure that all important data is committed.
Make a dry run first with **-n**.

If not the most recent commit was checked out,
the repository HEAD (in git terminology, see **git-checkout**(1)) becomes detached,
which prevents such operations as **pull** or **push**.
To advance the repository to its correct state, check out the last commit
or make a new one.

*commit*
: The commit name (as printed in **log** or during **commit**).

# clone

**yarsync clone** \[**-h**] *name* *path|parent-path*

One can clone from within an existing repository **to** *parent-path*
or clone **from** a repository at *path*.
In both cases a new directory with the repository is created,
having the same name as the original repository folder.
If that directory already exists, **clone** will fail
(several safety checks are being made).
The local repository (origin or clone) will add another one as a remote.

Note that only data (working directory, commits, logs and synchronization information,
not configuration files) will be cloned.
This command will refuse to clone **from** a repository with a filter (see SPECIAL REPOSITORIES).

*parent-path* is useful when we want to clone several repositories into one directory.
It allows us to use the same command for each of them (manually or with **mr**(1)).
If one needs to have a different directory name for a repository,
they can rename it manually
(we don't require, but strongly encourage having same directory names for all replicas).

### Positional arguments

*name*
: Name of the new repository.

*path*
: Path to the source repository (local or remote). Trailing slash is ignored.

*parent-path*
: Path to the parent directory of the cloned repository (local or remote).
Trailing slash is ignored.

# commit
**yarsync commit** \[**-h**] \[**-m** *message*] \[**--limit** *number*]

Commits the working directory (makes its snapshot).
See QUICK START for more details on commits.

**\--limit**=*number*
: Maximum number of commits.
If the current number of commits exceeds that, older ones
are removed during **commit**.
See SPECIAL REPOSITORIES for more details.

*message*
: Commit message (used in logs). Can be empty.

# diff

**yarsync diff** \[**-h**] *commit* \[*commit*]

Prints the difference between two commits
(from old to the new one, the order of arguments is unimportant).
If the second commit is omitted, compares *commit* to the most recent one.
See **status** for the output format.

*commit*
: Commit name.

# init

**yarsync init** \[**-h**] \[*reponame*]

Initializes a **yarsync** repository in the current directory.
Creates a configuration folder with repository files.
Existing configuration and files in the working directory stay unchanged.
Create a first commit for the repository to become fully operational.

*reponame*
: Name of the repository. If not provided on the command line, it will be prompted.

# log

**yarsync log** [**-h**] \[**-n** *number*] \[**-r**]

Prints commit logs (from newest to oldest),
as well as synchronization information when it is available.
To see changes in the working directory, use **status**.

### Options

**\--max-count**=*number*, **-n**
: Maximum number of logs shown.

**\--reverse**, **-r**
: Reverse log order.

### Example

To print information about the three most recent commits, use

    yarsync log -n 3

# pull

**yarsync pull** \[**-h**] \[**-f** | **\--new** | **-b** | **\--backup-dir** *DIR*] [**-n**] *source*

Gets data from a remote *source*.
The difference between **pull** and **push** is mostly only the direction of transfer.

**pull** and **push** bring two repositories into the same state.
They synchronize the working directory,
that is they add to the destination new files from source,
remove those missing on source
and do all renames and moves of previously committed files efficiently.
This is done in one run, and these changes apply also to
logs, commits and synchronization.
In most cases, we do not want our existing logs and commits to be removed though.
By default, several checks are made to prevent data loss:

    - local has no uncommitted changes,
    - local has not a detached HEAD,
    - local is not in a merging state,
    - destination has no commits missing on source.

If any of these cases is in effect, no modifications will be made.
Note that the remote may have uncommitted changes itself:
always make a dry run with **-n** first!

To commit local changes to the repository, use **commit**.
HEAD commit could be changed during **checkout** (see its section for the solutions).
If the destination has commits missing on source, there are two options:
to **\--force** changes to the destination (removing these commits)
or to merge changes inside the local repository with **pull \--new**.

If we pull new commits from the remote, this will bring repository into a merging state.
Merge will be done automatically if the last remote commit is among local ones
(in that case only some older commits were transferred from there).
If some recent remote commits are not present locally, however,
this means that histories of the repositories diverged,
and we will need to merge them manually.
After we have all local and remote commits
and the union of the working directories in our local repository,
we can safely choose the easiest way for us to merge them.
To see the changes, use **status** and **log**.
For example, if we added a file in a *remote_commit* before and it was added now,
we can just **commit** the changes.
If we have made many local changes, renames and removals since then, we may better
**checkout** our latest commit
(remember that all files from the working directory are present in commits,
so it is always safe)
and link the new file to the working directory:

    ln .ys/commits/<remote_commit>/path/to/file .

(it can be moved to its subdirectory without the risk of breaking hard links).
If the remote commit was actually large, and local changes were recent but small,
then we shall check out the remote commit and apply local changes by hand.
After our working directory is in the desired state,
we **commit** changes and the merge is finished.
The result shall be pushed to the remote without problems.

### pull options

**\--new**
: Do not remove local data that is missing on *source*.
While this option can return deleted or moved files
back to the working directory, it also adds remote logs and commits
that were missing here (for example, old or unsynchronized commits).
A forced **push** to the remote could remove
these logs and commits, and this option allows one to first **pull**
them to the local repository.

    After **pull \--new** the local repository can enter a merging state.
See **pull** description for more details.

**\--backup**, **-b**
: Changed files in the working directory are renamed (appended with \'**~**\').
See **\--backup-dir** for more details.

**\--backup-dir** *DIR*
: Changed local files are put into a directory *DIR* preserving their relative paths.
*DIR* can be an absolute path or relative to the root of the repository.
In contrast to **\--backup**, **\--backup-dir** does not change resulting file names.

    This option is convenient for large file trees,
because it recreates the existing file structure of the repository
(one doesn't have to search for new backup files in all subdirectories).
For current rsync version, the command

        yarsync pull --backup-dir BACKUP <remote>

    will copy updated files from the remote
and put them into the directory \"BACKUP/BACKUP\" (this is how rsync works).
To reduce confusion, make standard **pull** first
(so that during the backup there are only file updates).

    This option is available only for **pull**,
because it is assumed that the user will apply local file changes after backup.
For example, suppose that after a **pull \--backup**
one gets files *a* and *a~* in the working directory.
One should first see, which version is correct.
If it is the local file *a~*, then the backup can be removed:

        mv a~ a

    By local we mean the one hard linked with local commits
(run *ls -i* to be sure).
If the remote version is correct though, you need first to
overwrite the local version not breaking the hard links.
This can be done with an rsync option \"\--inplace\":

        rsync --inplace a a~
        mv a~ a
        # check file contents and the links
        ls -i a .ys/commits/*/a

    For a **\--backup-dir** and for longer paths these commands will be longer.
Finally, if you need several versions,
just save one of the files under a different name in the repository.

    After you have fixed all corrupt files, push them back to the remote.

### pull and push options

**\--force**, **-f**
: Updates the working directory, removing commits and logs missing on source.
This command brings two repositories to the nearest possible states:
their working directories, commits and logs become the same.
While working directories are always identical after **pull** or **push**
(except for some of the **pull** options),
**yarsync** generally refuses to remove existing commits or logs \- unless
this option is given.
Use it if the destination has really unneeded commits
or just remove them manually (see FILES for details on the commit directory).
See also **pull \--new** on how to fetch missing commits.

# push

**yarsync push** \[**-h**] \[**-f**] \[**-n**] *destination*

Sends data to a remote *destination*. See **pull** for more details and common options.

# remote
**yarsync remote** \[**-h**] \[**-v**] \[*command*]

Manages remote repositories configuration.
By default, prints existing remotes.
For more options, see *.ys/config.ini* in the FILES section.

**-v**
: Verbose. Prints remote paths as well.

### **add**

**yarsync remote add** \[**-h**] *repository* *path*

Adds a new remote.
*repository* is the name of the remote in local **yarsync** configuration
(as it will be used later during **pull** or **push**).
*path* has a standard form \[user@]host:\[path] for an actually remote host
or it can be a local path. Since **yarsync** commands can be called
from any subdirectory, local path should be absolute.
Tilde for user's home directory \'**~**\' in paths is allowed.

### rm

**yarsync remote rm** \[**-h**\] *repository*

Removes an existing *repository* from local configuration.

### show
Prints remote repositories. Default.

# show
**yarsync show** \[**-h**] *commit* \[*commit* ...\]

Prints log messages and actual changes for commit(s).
Changes are shown compared to the commit before *commit*.
For the output format, see **status**.
Information for several commits can be requested as well.

*commit*
: Commit name.

# status

**yarsync status** \[**-h**]

Prints working directory updates since the last commit and the repository status.
If there were no errors, this command always returns success
(irrespective of uncommitted changes).

### Output format of the updates

The output for the updates is a list of changes, including attribute changes,
and is based on the format of *rsync \--itemize-changes*.
For example, a line

    .d..t...... programming/

means that the modification time \'*t*\' of the directory \'*d*\' *programming/*
in the root of the repository has changed (files were added or removed from that).
All its other attributes are unchanged (\'.\').

The output is an 11-letter string of the format \"YXcstpoguax\",
where \'Y\' is the update type, \'X\' is the file type,
and the other letters represent attributes
that are printed if they were changed.
For a newly created file these would be \'+\', like

    >f+++++++++ /path/to/file

The attribute letters are: **c**hecksum, **s**ize, modification **t**ime,
**p**ermissions, **o**wner and **g**roup.
**u** can be in fact **u**se (access) or creatio**n** time, or **b**oth.
**a** stands for ACL, and **x** for extended attributes.
Complete details on the output format can be found in the **rsync**(1) manual.

# SPECIAL REPOSITORIES

A **detached** repository is one with the **yarsync** configuration directory
outside the working directory.
To use such repository, one must provide **yarsync** options
**\--config-dir** and **\--root-dir** with every command
(**alias**(1p) may be of help).
To create a detached repository, use **init** with these options
or move the existing configuration directory manually.
For example, if one wants to have several versions of static Web pages,
they may create a detached repository and publish the working directory
without the Web server having access to the configuration.
Alternatively, if one really wants to have both a continuous synchronization
and **yarsync** backups, they can move its configuration outside, if that will work.
Commits in such repositories can be created or checked out,
but **pull** or **push** are currently not supported
(one will have to synchronize them manually).
A detached repository is similar to a bare repository in git,
but usually has a working directory.

A repository with a **filter** can exclude (disable tracking) some files or directories
from the working directory.
This may be convenient, but makes synchronization less reliable,
and such repository can not be used as a remote.
See **rsync-filter** in the FILES section for more details.

A repository can have a **commit limit**.
The maximum number of commits can be set during **commit**.
**pull** and **push** do not check for missing commits on the destination
when we are in a repository with commit limit.
It makes a repository with commit limit more like a central repository.
If we have reached the maximum number of commits,
older ones are deleted during a new **commit**.
Commit limit is stored in **.ys/COMMIT_LIMIT.txt**.
It can be changed or removed at any time.
Commit limit was introduced in ``yarsync v0.2`` and was designed to help
against the problem of too many hard links (if it exists).

# FILES

All **yarsync** repository configuration and data is stored
in the hidden directory **.ys** under the root of the working directory.
If the user no longer wants to use **yarsync** and the working directory
is in the desired state, they can safely remove the **.ys** directory.

Apart from the working directory, only commits,
logs and synchronization data are synchronized between the repositories.
Each repository has its own configuration and name.

## User configuration files

**.ys/config.ini**
: Contains names and paths of remote repositories.
This file can be edited directly or with **remote** commands
according to user's preference.

    **yarsync** supports synchronization
only with existing remotes.
A simple configuration for a remote \"my\_remote\" could be:

        [my_remote]
        path = remote:/path/on/my/remote

    Several sections can be added for more remotes.
An example (non-effective) configuration is created during **init**.
Note that comments in **config.ini** can be erased
during **remote** {**add**,**rm**}.

    Since removable media or remote hosts can change their paths
or IP addresses, one may use variable substitution in paths:

        [my_drive]
        path = $MY_DRIVE/my_repo

    For the substitutions to take the effect,
export these variables before run:

        $ export MY_DRIVE=/run/media/my_drive
        $ yarsync push -n my_drive

    If we made a mistake in the variable or path,
it will be shown in the printed command.
Always use **\--dry-run** first to ensure proper synchronization.

    Another **yarsync** remote configuration option is **host**.
If both **path** and **host** are present, the effective path
will be their concatenation \"\<host\>:\<path\>\".
Empty **host** means local host and does not prepend the path.

    It is possible to set default **host** for each section
from the section name.
For that, add a default section with an option **host_from_section_name**:

        [DEFAULT]
        host_from_section_name

    Empty lines and lines starting with \'**#**\' are ignored.
Section names are case-sensitive.
White spaces in a section name will be considered parts of its name.
Spaces around \'**=**\' are allowed.
Full syntax specification can be found at
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html>.

**.ys/repo_\<name\>.txt**
: Contains the repository name, which is used in logs
and usually should coincide with the remote name
(how local repository is called on remotes).
The name can be set during **init** or edited manually.

    Each repository replica must have a unique name.
For example, if one has repositories \"programming/\" and \"music/\"
on a laptop \"my\_host\", their names would probably be \"my\_host\",
and the names of their copies on an external drive could be \"my\_drive\"
(this is different from git, which uses only the author's name in logs).

    Note that **clone** from inside a repository
for technical reasons creates a temporary file with the new repository name
(which is also written in **CLONE_TO_\<name\>.txt**).
If these files due to some errors remain on the system, they can be safely removed.

**.ys/rsync-filter**
: Contains rsync filter rules, which effectively define what data belongs
to the repository.
The **rsync-filter** does not exist by default, but can be added for flexibility.

    For example, the author has a repository \"~/work\",
but wants to keep his presentations in \"tex/\" in a separate repository.
Instead of having a different directory \"~/work\_tex\", he adds such rules
to **rsync-filter**:

        # all are in git repositories
        - /repos
        # take care to sync separately
        - /tex

    In this way, \"~/work/tex\" and contained git repositories will be excluded
from \"~/work\" synchronization. Lines starting with \'**#**\' are ignored,
as well as empty lines. To complicate things, one could include a subdirectory
of \"tex\" into \"work\" with an include filter \'**+**\'.
For complete details, see FILTER RULES section of **rsync**(1).

    While convenient for everyday use, filters make backup more difficult.
To synchronize a repository with them, one has to remember that it has subdirectories
that need to be synchronized too. If the remote repository had
its own filters, that would make synchronization even more unreliable.
Therefore filters are generally discouraged: **pull** and **push** ignore
remote filters (make sure you synchronize only *from* a repository with filters),
while **clone** refuses to copy from a repository with **rsync-filter**.

## yarsync technical directories
**.ys/commits/**
: Contains local commits (snapshots of the working directory).
If some of the old commits are no longer needed (there are too many of them
or they contain a large file), they can be removed.
Make sure, however, that all remote repositories contain at least some of
the present commits, otherwise future synchronization will get complicated.
Alternatively, remove unneeded files or folders manually:
commits can be edited, with care taken to synchronize them correctly.

**.ys/logs/**
: Contains text logs produced during **commit**.
They are not necessary, so removing any of them will not break the repository.
If one wants to fix or improve a commit message though,
they may edit the corresponding log
(the change will be propagated during **push**).
It is recommended to store logs even for old deleted commits,
which may be present on formerly used devices.

**.ys/sync/**
: Contains synchronization information for all known reposotories.
This information is transferred between replicas during ``pull``, ``push`` and ``clone``,
and it allows ``yarsync`` repositories to better support the 3-2-1 backup rule.
The information is contained in empty files with names of the format **commit_repo.txt**.
Pulling (or cloning) from a repository does not affect its files
and does not update its synchronization information.
**push** (and corresponding **clone**) updates synchronization for both replicas.
For each repository only the most recent commit is stored.
**sync** directory was introduced in ``yarsync v0.2``.
See the release notes on how to convert old repositories to the new format
or do it manually, if necessary.

    If a replica has been permanently removed, its synchronization data
must be removed manually and propagated with **\--force**.

# EXIT STATUS

**0**
: Success

**1**
: Invalid option

**7**
: Configuration error

**8**
: Command error

**9**
: System error

**2-6**,**10-14**,**20-25**,**30**,**35**
: rsync error

If the command could be run successfully, a zero code is returned.
Invalid option code is returned for mistakes in command line argument syntax.
Configuration error can occur when we are outside an existing repository
or a **yarsync** configuration file is missing.
If the repository is correct, but the command is not allowed in its current state
(for example, one can not push or pull when there are uncommitted changes
or add a remote with an already present name), the command error is returned.
It is also possible that a general system error, such as a keyboard interrupt,
is raised in the Python interpreter. See **rsync**(1) for rsync errors.

# DIAGNOSTICS

To check that your clocks (used for properly ordering commits) at different hosts
are synchronized well enough, run

    python -c 'import time; print(time.time())'

To make sure that the local repository supports hard links
instead of creating file copies, test it with

    du -sh .
    du -sh .ys

(can be run during **pull** or **clone** if they take too long).
The results must be almost the same. If not, you may not use **yarsync**
on this file system, have large deleted files stored in old commits
or you may have subdirectories excluded with a **filter**
(see SPECIAL REPOSITORIES section).

To test that a particular file \"a\" was hard linked to its committed versions, run

    ls -i a .ys/commits/*/a

If all is correct, their inodes must be the same.

Hard links can be broken in a cloned git repository
(as it could happen with **yarsync** tests before),
because git does not preserve them.
To fix hard links for the whole repository, run **hardlink**(1) in its root.
