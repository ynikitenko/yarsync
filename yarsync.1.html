<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Yet Another Rsync is a file synchronization and backup tool</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>yarsync</strong> [<strong>-h</strong>]
[<strong>--config-dir</strong> <em>DIR</em>]
[<strong>--root-dir</strong> <em>DIR</em>] [<strong>-q</strong> |
<strong>-v</strong>] <em>command</em> [<em>args</em>]</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>yarsync</strong> is a wrapper around rsync to store its
configuration and synchronize repositories with the interface similar to
git. It is <em>efficient</em> (files in the repository can be removed
and renamed freely without additional transfers), <em>distributed</em>
(several replicas of the repository can diverge, and in that case a
manual merge is supported), <em>safe</em> (it takes care to prevent data
loss and corruption) and <em>simple</em> (see this manual).</p>
<h1 id="quick-start">QUICK START</h1>
<p>To create a new repository, enter the directory with its files and
type</p>
<pre><code>yarsync init</code></pre>
<p>This operation is safe and will not affect existing files (including
configuration files in an existing repository). Alternatively, run
<strong>init</strong> inside an empty directory and add files
afterwards. To complete the initialization, make a commit:</p>
<pre><code>yarsync commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>commit</strong> creates a snapshot of the working directory,
which is all files in the repository except <strong>yarsync</strong>
configuration and data. This snapshot is very small, because it uses
hard links. To check how much your directory size has changed, run
<strong>du</strong>(1).</p>
<p>Commit name is the number of seconds since the Epoch (integer Unix
time). This allows commits to be ordered in time, even for hosts in
different zones. Though this works on most Unix systems and Windows, the
epoch is platform dependent.</p>
<p>After creating a commit, files can be renamed, deleted or added. To
see what was changed since the last commit, use <strong>status</strong>.
To see the history of existing commits, use <strong>log</strong>.</p>
<p>Hard links are excellent at tracking file moves or renames and
storing accidentally removed files. Their downside is that if a file
gets corrupt, this will apply to all of its copies in local commits. The
3-2-1 backup rule implies that one should have at least 3 copies of
data, so let us add a remote repository "my_remote":</p>
<pre><code>yarsync remote add my_remote remote:/path/on/my/remote</code></pre>
<p>For local copies we still call the repositories "remote", but their
paths will be local:</p>
<pre><code>yarsync remote add my_drive /mnt/my_drive/my_repo</code></pre>
<p>This command only updated our configuration, but did not make any
changes at the remote path (which may not exist). To make a local copy
of our repository, run</p>
<pre><code>yarsync clone . /mnt/my_drive/my_repo</code></pre>
<p><strong>clone</strong> copies all repository data (except the
configuration) to the new replica and adds the original repository to
its remotes with the name "origin". To copy the repository to a remote
host, just copy its files (preserving hard links):</p>
<pre><code>rsync -avHP ./ remote:/path/on/my/remote</code></pre>
<p>Here '<strong>-H</strong>' stands for hard links. If the first path
ends with a slash, data will be copied to "remote/", otherwise to its
subdirectory. Similarly, one can copy a repository <em>from</em> a
remote: just change the order of paths and donâ€™t forget about the slash.
To check that we set up the repositories correctly, make a dry run with
'<strong>-n</strong>':</p>
<pre><code>yarsync push -n my_remote</code></pre>
<p>If there are no errors and no file transfers, then we have a
functioning remote. We can continue working locally, adding and removing
files and making commits. When we want to synchronize repositories, we
<strong>push</strong> the changes <em>to</em> or <strong>pull</strong>
them <em>from</em> a remote (first with a <strong>--dry-run</strong>).
This is the recommended workflow, and if we work on different
repositories in sequence and always synchronize changes, our life will
be easy. Sometimes, however, we may forget to synchronize two replicas
and they will end up in a diverged state; we may actually change some
files or find them corrupt. Solutions to these problems involve user
decisions and are described in <strong>pull</strong> and
<strong>push</strong> options.</p>

[<strong>-f</strong> | <strong>--new</strong> | <strong>-b</strong> |
<strong>--backup-dir</strong> <em>DIR</em>] [<strong>-n</strong>]
[<strong>--overwrite</strong>] <em>source</em></p>
<p>Gets data from a remote <em>source</em>. The difference between
<strong>pull</strong> and <strong>push</strong> is mostly only the
direction of transfer.</p>
<p><strong>pull</strong> and <strong>push</strong> bring two
repositories into the same state. They synchronize the working
directory, that is they add to the destination new files from source,
remove those missing on source and do all renames and moves of
previously committed files efficiently. This is done in one run, and
these changes apply also to logs and commits. In most cases, we do not
want our existing logs and commits to be removed though. By default,
several checks are made to prevent data loss:</p>
<pre><code>- local has no uncommitted changes,
- local has not a detached HEAD,
- local is not in a merging state,
- destination has no commits missing on source.</code></pre>
<p>If any of these cases is in effect, no modifications will be made.
Note that the remote may have uncommitted changes itself: always make a
dry run with <strong>-n</strong> first!</p>
<p>To commit local changes to the repository, use
<strong>commit</strong>. HEAD commit could be changed during
<strong>checkout</strong> (see its section for the solutions). If the
destination has commits missing on source, there are two options: to
<strong>--force</strong> changes to the destination (removing these
commits) or to merge changes inside the local repository with
<strong>pull --new</strong>.</p>
<p>If we pull new commits from the remote, this will bring repository
into a merging state. Merge will be done automatically if the last
remote commit is among local ones (in that case only some older commits
were transferred from there). If some recent remote commits are not
present locally, however, this means that histories of the repositories
diverged, and we will need to merge them manually. After we have all
local and remote commits and the union of the working directories in our
local repository, we can safely choose the easiest way for us to merge
them. To see the changes, use <strong>status</strong> and
<strong>log</strong>. For example, if we added a file in a
<em>remote_commit</em> before and it was added now, we can just
<strong>commit</strong> the changes. If we have made many local changes,
renames and removals since then, we may better <strong>checkout</strong>
our latest commit (remember that all files from the working directory
are present in commits, so it is always safe) and link the new file to
the working directory:</p>
<pre><code>ln .ys/commits/&lt;remote_commit&gt;/path/to/file .</code></pre>
<p>(it can be moved to its subdirectory without the risk of breaking
hard links). If the remote commit was actually large, and local changes
were recent but small, then we shall check out the remote commit and
apply local changes by hand. After our working directory is in the
desired state, we <strong>commit</strong> changes and the merge is
finished. The result shall be pushed to the remote without problems.</p>
<h3 id="pull-options">pull options</h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--new</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not remove local data that is missing on <em>source</em>. While
this option can return deleted or moved files back to the working
directory, it also adds remote logs and commits that were missing here
(for example, old or unsynchronized commits). A forced
<strong>push</strong> to the remote could remove these logs and commits,
and this option allows one to <strong>pull</strong> them first to the
local repository.</p>
<p>After <strong>pull --new</strong> the local repository can enter a
merging state. See <strong>pull</strong> description for more
details.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>--backup</strong>, <strong>-b</strong></dt>
<dd>
Changed files in the working directory are renamed (appended with
'<strong>~</strong>'). See <strong>--backup-dir</strong> for more
details.
</dd>
<dt><strong>--backup-dir</strong> <em>DIR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Changed local files are put into a directory <em>DIR</em> preserving
their relative paths. <em>DIR</em> can be an absolute path or relative
to the root of the repository. In contrast to <strong>--backup</strong>,
<strong>--backup-dir</strong> does not change resulting file names.</p>
<p>This option is convenient for large file trees, because it recreates
the existing file structure of the repository (one doesnâ€™t have to
search for new backup files in all subdirectories). For current rsync
version, the command</p>
<pre><code>yarsync pull --backup-dir BACKUP &lt;remote&gt;</code></pre>
<p>will copy updated files from the remote and put them into the
directory "BACKUP/BACKUP" (this is how rsync works). To reduce
confusion, make standard <strong>pull</strong> first (so that during the
backup there are only file updates).</p>
<p>This option is available only for <strong>pull</strong>, because it
is assumed that the user will apply local file changes after backup. For
example, suppose that after a <strong>pull --backup</strong> one gets
files <em>a</em> and <em>a~</em> in the working directory. One should
first see, which version is correct. If it is the local file
<em>a~</em>, then the backup can be removed:</p>
<pre><code>mv a~ a*</code></pre>
<p>By local we mean the one hard linked with local commits (run <em>ls
-i</em> to be sure). If the remote version is correct though, you need
first to overwrite the local version not breaking the hard links. This
can be done with an rsync option "--inplace":</p>
<pre><code>rsync --inplace a a~
mv a~ a
# check file contents and the links
ls -i a .ys/commits/*/a</code></pre>
<p>For a <strong>--backup-dir</strong> and for longer paths these
commands will be longer. Finally, if you need several versions, just
save one of the files under a different name in the repository.</p>
<p>After you have fixed all corrupt files, push them back to the remote.
See the <strong>--overwrite</strong> option for propagation of file
changes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="pull-and-push-options">pull and push options</h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--force</strong>, <strong>-f</strong></dt>
<dd>
Updates the working directory, removing commits and logs missing on
source. This command brings two repositories to the nearest possible
states: their working directories, commits and logs become the same.
While working directories are always identical after
<strong>pull</strong> or <strong>push</strong> (except for some of the
<strong>pull</strong> options), <strong>yarsync</strong> generally
refuses to remove existing commits or logs - unless this option is
given. Use it if the destination has really unneeded commits or just
remove them manually (see FILES for details on the commit directory).
See also <strong>pull --new</strong> on how to fetch missing commits and
<strong>--overwrite</strong> on synchronizing file contents.
</dd>
<dt><strong>--overwrite</strong></dt>
<dd>
Propagates file changes. By default, files in a <strong>yarsync</strong>
repository are not changed, therefore actual changes are not transferred
to other repositories to prevent file corruption. If you are confident
that the local files for <strong>push</strong> (or remote ones for
<strong>pull</strong>) are correct (for example, you just repaired them
with the <strong>--backup</strong> options), you can synchronize changes
with this option.

<h1 id="push">push</h1>
<p><strong>yarsync push</strong> [<strong>-h</strong>]

<h1 id="remote">remote</h1>
<p><strong>yarsync remote</strong> [<strong>-h</strong>]
[<strong>-v</strong>] [<em>command</em>]</p>

<h3 id="add"><strong>add</strong></h3>
<p><strong>yarsync remote add</strong> [<strong>-h</strong>]
<em>repository</em> <em>path</em></p>
<p>Adds a new remote. <em>repository</em> is the name of the remote in
local <strong>yarsync</strong> configuration (as it will be used later
during <strong>pull</strong> or <strong>push</strong>). <em>path</em>
has a standard form [user@]host:[path] for an actually remote host or it
can be a local path. Since <strong>yarsync</strong> commands can be
called from any subdirectory, local path should be absolute. Tilde for
userâ€™s home directory '<strong>~</strong>' in paths is allowed.</p>

<h1 id="show-1">show</h1>
<p><strong>yarsync show</strong> [<strong>-h</strong>] <em>commit</em>
[<em>commit</em> â€¦]</p>
<p>Prints log messages and actual changes for commit(s). Changes are
shown compared to the commit before <em>commit</em>. For the output
format, see <strong>status</strong>. Information for several commits can
be requested as well.</p>

<p><strong>yarsync status</strong> [<strong>-h</strong>]</p>
<p>Prints working directory updates since the last commit and the
repository status. If there were no errors, this command always returns
success (irrespective of uncommitted changes).</p>
<h3 id="output-format-of-the-updates">Output format of the updates</h3>
<p>The output for the updates is a list of changes, including attribute
changes, and is based on the format of <em>rsync --itemize-changes</em>.
For example, a line</p>
<pre><code>.d..t...... programming/</code></pre>
<p>means that the modification time '<em>t</em>' of the directory
'<em>d</em>' <em>programming/</em> in the root of the repository has
changed (files were added or removed from that). All its other
attributes are unchanged ('.').</p>
<p>The output is an 11-letter string of the format "YXcstpoguax", where
'Y' is the update type, 'X' is the file type, and the other letters
represent attributes that are printed if they were changed. For a newly
created file these would be '+', like</p>
<pre><code>&gt;f+++++++++ /path/to/file</code></pre>
<p>The attribute letters are: <strong>c</strong>hecksum,
<strong>s</strong>ize, modification <strong>t</strong>ime,
<strong>p</strong>ermissions, <strong>o</strong>wner and
<strong>g</strong>roup. <strong>u</strong> can be in fact
<strong>u</strong>se (access) or creatio<strong>n</strong> time, or
<strong>b</strong>oth. <strong>a</strong> stands for ACL, and
<strong>x</strong> for extended attributes. Complete details on the
output format can be found in the <strong>rsync</strong>(1) manual.</p>
<h1 id="special-repositories">SPECIAL REPOSITORIES</h1>
<p>A <strong>detached</strong> repository is one with the
<strong>yarsync</strong> configuration directory outside the working
directory. To use such repository, one must provide
<strong>yarsync</strong> options <strong>--config-dir</strong> and
<strong>--root-dir</strong> with every command
(<strong>alias</strong>(1p) may be of help). To create a detached
repository, use <strong>init</strong> with these options or move the
existing configuration directory manually. For example, if one wants to
have several versions of static Web pages, they may create a detached
repository and publish the working directory without the Web server
having access to the configuration. Alternatively, if one really wants
to have both a continuous synchronization and <strong>yarsync</strong>
backups, they can move its configuration outside, if that will work.
Commits in such repositories can be created or checked out, but
<strong>pull</strong> or <strong>push</strong> are currently not
supported (one will have to synchronize them manually). A detached
repository is similar to a bare repository in git, but usually has a
working directory.</p>
<p>A repository with a <strong>filter</strong> can exclude (disable
tracking) some files or directories from the working directory. This may
be convenient, but makes synchronization less reliable, and such
repository can not be used as a remote. See
<strong>rsync-filter</strong> in the FILES section for more details.</p>
<h1 id="files">FILES</h1>
<p>All <strong>yarsync</strong> repository configuration and data is
stored in the hidden directory <strong>.ys</strong> under the root of
the working directory. If the user no longer wants to use
<strong>yarsync</strong> and the working directory is in the desired
state, they can safely remove the <strong>.ys</strong> directory.</p>
<p>Note that only commits and logs (apart from the working directory)
are synchronized between the repositories. Each repository has its own
configuration and name.</p>
<h2 id="user-configuration-files">User configuration files</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>.ys/config.ini</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains names and paths of remote repositories. This file can be
edited directly or with <strong>remote</strong> commands according to
userâ€™s preference.</p>
<p><strong>yarsync</strong> supports synchronization with only existing
remotes. A simple configuration for a remote "my_remote" could be:</p>
<pre><code>[my_remote]
path = remote:/path/on/my/remote</code></pre>
<p>Several sections can be added for more remotes. An example
(non-effective) configuration is created during <strong>init</strong>.
Note that comments in <strong>config.ini</strong> can be erased during
<strong>remote</strong> {<strong>add</strong>,<strong>rm</strong>}.</p>
<p>Since removable media or remote hosts can change their paths or IP
addresses, one may use variable substitution in paths:</p>
<pre><code>[my_drive]
path = $MY_DRIVE/my_repo</code></pre>
<p>For the substitutions to take the effect, export these variables
before run:</p>
<pre><code>$ export MY_DRIVE=/run/media/my_drive
$ yarsync push -n my_drive</code></pre>
<p>If we made a mistake in the variable or path, it will be shown in the
printed command. Always use <strong>--dry-run</strong> first to ensure
proper synchronization.</p>
<p>Another <strong>yarsync</strong> remote configuration option is
<strong>host</strong>. If both <strong>path</strong> and
<strong>host</strong> are present, the effective path will be their
concatenation "&lt;host&gt;:&lt;path&gt;". Empty <strong>host</strong>
means local host and does not prepend the path.</p>
<p>It is possible to set default <strong>host</strong> for each section
from the section name. For that, add a default section with an option
<strong>host_from_section_name</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>[DEFAULT]
host_from_section_name</code></pre>
<p>Empty lines and lines starting with '<strong>#</strong>' are ignored.
Section names are case-sensitive. White spaces in a section name will be
considered parts of its name. Spaces around '<strong>=</strong>' are
allowed. Full syntax specification can be found at <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html"
class="uri">https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>.ys/repository.txt</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains the repository name, which is used in logs and usually
coincides with the remote name (how local repository is called on
remotes). The name can be set during <strong>init</strong> or edited
later.</p>
<p>It is recommended (but not required) to have different names for the
repository replicas on different hosts or devices. For example, if one
has repositories "programming/" and "music/" on a laptop "my_host",
their names would probably be "my_host", and the names of their copies
on an external drive could be "my_drive" (this is different from git,
which uses only the authorâ€™s name in logs). If one never creates commits
directly on "my_drive", these names can be empty.</p>
<p>If the repository name is missing (empty or no file), host name will
be used. If there is an error getting the host name during
<strong>commit</strong>, provide the name in the
<strong>repository.txt</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>.ys/rsync-filter</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains rsync filter rules, which effectively define what data
belongs to the repository. The <strong>rsync-filter</strong> does not
exist by default, but can be added for flexibility.</p>
<p>For example, the author has a repository "~/work", but wants to keep
his presentations in "tex/" in a separate repository. Instead of having
a different directory "~/work_tex", he adds such rules to
<strong>rsync-filter</strong>:</p>
<pre><code># all are in git repositories
- /repos
# take care to sync separately
- /tex</code></pre>
<p>In this way, "~/work/tex" and contained git repositories will be
excluded from "~/work" synchronization. Lines starting with
'<strong>#</strong>' are ignored, as well as empty lines. To complicate
things, one can include a subdirectory of "tex" into "work" with an
include filter '<strong>+</strong>'. For complete details, see FILTER
RULES section of <strong>rsync</strong>(1).</p>
<p>While convenient for everyday use, filters make backup more
difficult. To synchronize repository with them, one has to remember that
it has subdirectories that need to be synchronized too. If the remote
repository had its own filters, that would make synchronization even
more unreliable. Therefore filters are generally discouraged:
<strong>pull</strong> and <strong>push</strong> ignore remote filters
(make sure you synchronize only <em>from</em> a repository with
filters), while <strong>clone</strong> refuses to copy a repository with
<strong>rsync-filter</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="yarsync-technical-directories">yarsync technical
directories</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>.ys/commits/</strong></dt>
<dd>
Contains local commits (snapshots of the working directory). If some of
the old commits are no longer needed (there are too many of them or they
contain a large file), they can be removed. Make sure, however, that all
remote repositories contain at least some of the present commits,
otherwise future synchronization will get complicated. Alternatively,
remove unneeded files or folders manually: commits can be edited, with
care taken to synchronize them correctly.
</dd>
<dt><strong>.ys/logs/</strong></dt>
<dd>
Contains text logs produced during <strong>commit</strong>. They are not
necessary, so removing any of them will not break the repository. If one
wants to fix or improve a commit message though, they may edit the
corresponding log (the change will be propagated during
<strong>push</strong> with the <strong>--overwrite</strong> option). It
is recommended to store logs even for old deleted commits, which may be
present on formerly used devices.

<p>If the command could be run successfully, a zero code is returned.
Invalid option code is returned for mistakes in command line argument
syntax. Configuration error can occur when we are outside an existing
repository or a <strong>yarsync</strong> configuration file is missing.
If the repository is correct, but the command is not allowed in its
current state (for example, one can not push or pull when there are
uncommitted changes or add a remote with an already present name), the
command error is returned. It is also possible that a general system
error, such as a keyboard interrupt, is raised in the Python
interpreter.</p>
<p>In case of rsync errors, its error code is returned.</p>
<h1 id="diagnostics">DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
<p>To check that your clocks (used for properly ordering commits) at
different hosts are synchronized well enough, run</p>
<pre><code>python -c &#39;import time; print(time.time())&#39;</code></pre>
<p>To make sure that the local repository supports hard links instead of
creating file copies, test it with</p>
<pre><code>du -sh .
du -sh .ys</code></pre>
<p>(can be run during <strong>pull</strong> or <strong>clone</strong> if
they take too long). The results must be almost the same. If not, you
may not use <strong>yarsync</strong> on this file system, have large
deleted files stored in old commits or you may have subdirectories
excluded with a <strong>filter</strong> (see SPECIAL REPOSITORIES
section).</p>
<p>To test that a particular file "a" was hard linked to its committed
versions, run</p>
<pre><code>ls -i a .ys/commits/*/a</code></pre>
<p>If all is correct, their inodes must be the same.</p>
<p>Hard links may be broken in a cloned git repository (as it happens
with <strong>yarsync</strong> tests), because git does not preserve
them. To fix hard links for the whole repository, run
<strong>hardlink</strong>(1) in its root.</p>
