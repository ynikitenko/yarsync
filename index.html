<h1 class="title">YARsync</h1>

<p>Yet Another Rsync is a file synchronization and backup tool.
It can be used to synchronize data between different hosts
or locally (for example, to a backup drive).
It provides a familiar <tt class="docutils literal">git</tt> command interface while working with files.</p>
<div class="section" id="design-and-features">
<h1>Design and features</h1>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> can be used to manage hierarchies of unchanging files,
such as music, books, articles, photographs, etc.
Its final goal is to have the same state of files across
different computers.
It also allows to store backup copies of data and easily copy, update or recover that.
<tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> is</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>distributed</dt>
<dd>There is no central host or repository for <tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt>.
If different replicas diverge,
the program assists the user to merge the repositories manually.</dd>
<dt>efficient</dt>
<dd>The program is run only on user demand,
and does not consume system resources constantly.
Already transferred files will never be transmitted again.
This allows the user to rename or move files
or whole directories without any costs,
driving constant improvements on the repository.</dd>
<dt>non-intrusive</dt>
<dd><tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> does nothing to user data.
It has no complicated packing or unpacking.
All user data and program configuration are stored as usual files in the file system.
If one decides to stop using <tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt>,
they can simply remove the configuration directory at any time.</dd>
<dt>simple</dt>
<dd><tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> does not implement complicated file transfer algorithms,
but uses an existing, widely accepted and tested tool for that.
User configuration is stored in simple text files,
and repository snapshots are usual directories, which can be modified, copied
or browsed from a file manager.
All standard command line tools can be used in the repository,
to assist its recovery or to allow any non-standard operations
(for the users who understand what they do).
Read the <tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> documentation to understand its (simple) design.</dd>
<dt>safe</dt>
<dd><tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> does its best to preserve user data.
It always allows one to see what will be done before any actual modifications
(<em>--dry-run</em>).
Removed files are stored in older commits
(until the user explicitly removes those).
If a file gets corrupt, it will not be transferred by default,
but when the user chooses to <em>pull --backup</em>, any diverged files will be visible
(with their different versions preserved).</dd>

<h1>Requirements and limitations</h1>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> is a <tt class="docutils literal">Python</tt> wrapper around <tt class="docutils literal">rsync</tt>
and requires a file system with <strong>hard links</strong>.
Since these are very common tools,
this means that it can easily run on any UNIX-like system.
Moreover, <tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> is not required to be installed on the remote host:
it is sufficient for <tt class="docutils literal">rsync</tt> to be installed there.</p>
<p>In particular, <tt class="docutils literal">rsync</tt> can be found:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>installed on most GNU/Linux distributions,</li>
<li>installed on <a class="reference external" href="https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/45185-mac-101-learn-the-power-of-rsync-for-backup-remote-archive-systems/">Mac OS</a>,</li>
<li>can be installed on <a class="reference external" href="https://superuser.com/questions/300263/how-to-use-rsync-from-windows-pc-to-remote-linux-server">Windows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> runs successfully on Linux.
Please report to us if you have problems (or success) running it on your system.</p>

<div class="section" id="safety">
<h1>Safety</h1>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">yarsync</tt> has been used by the author for several years without problems and is tested.
However, any data synchronization may lead to data loss,
and it is recommended to have several data copies
and always do a <em>--dry-run</em> (<em>-n</em>) first before the actual transfer.</p>
